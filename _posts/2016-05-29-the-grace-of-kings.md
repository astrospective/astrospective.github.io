## The Grace of Kings

Just finished up Ken Liu's [The Grace of Kings](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18952341-the-grace-of-kings). This isn't a full review, but definitely a endorsement. I needed something different and it fit the bill, the characters are fantastic and I love the lack of moustache-twirling villany. People have reasonable motivations, and for the most part even when they come into conflict they believe they're doing the right thing. The setting is fantastic, and the fact that it's explicitly book one of a series has me excited to see the rest.
