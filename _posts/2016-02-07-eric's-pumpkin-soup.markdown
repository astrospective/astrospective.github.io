* 1 lbs Fresh Andouille Sausage from [The Meat Shop](http://www.themeatshopaz.com)
* 1 14 oz can Coconut Cream (I use Savoy)
* 1 14 oz can Pumpkin
* 1/2 tsp Cumin
* 1 tsp Garlic powder
* Red pepper flakes, salt, and cracked pepper to taste

Get a little bit of oil going in a heavy pot and then brown the Andouille (remove the casings first). Once it's browned add the pumpkin, coconut cream and seasonings. Simmer until heated all the way through, 10-15 minutes approx.
